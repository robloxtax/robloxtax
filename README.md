# Roblox Tax Calculator by robloxtax.com (2026 Updated)

**robloxtax.com** is the essential utility for Roblox developers, traders, and clothing designers. This tool eliminates the guesswork from the Roblox economy by providing instant calculations for the **30% Marketplace Fee** and accurate **DevEx (Developer Exchange)** conversions using the latest 2026 exchange rates.

### 🌟 Why use this tool?

*   **Accurate Tax Calculation:** Roblox automatically deducts a **30% fee** from all Marketplace sales (Gamepasses, Clothing, UGC) [2, 3]. Our calculator shows you exactly how much you will keep (70%) and uses a **Reverse Calculator** to tell you exactly what price to list your item at to earn your target Robux [5].
*   **Up-to-Date DevEx Rates:** Unlike older calculators, we support the **New Exchange Rate ($0.0038/R$)** effective for earnings after September 5, 2025, while maintaining the "Old Rate" ($0.0035/R$) for legacy balances [1, 6].
*   **Pending Robux Estimates:** Understand the escrow period. Learn why your sales are held for **3 to 7 days** (or up to 30 days for large transactions) before becoming usable [4, 7].
