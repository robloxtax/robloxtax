## 📖 About The Project

This repository hosts the source code for **[robloxtax.com](https://robloxtax.com)**, a utility website designed to help Roblox developers, traders, and clothing designers maximize their earnings. 

While the Roblox platform takes a mandatory **30% fee** on all sales, understanding your exact net profit is crucial for pricing Gamepasses and Limited items correctly.

### Key Features on [RobloxTax.com](https://robloxtax.com):

1.  **Instant Tax Calculator: Input any amount to see the 30% deduction and your 70% net profit immediately.
2.  **Reverse Calculator**: Want to earn exactly 100 Robux? Our tool tells you exactly what price to list your item for (e.g., list for 143 R$).
3.  **2026 DevEx Rate Support**: Unlike older tools, we support the **New Exchange Rate ($0.0038/R$)** for Robux earned after September 5, 2025, alongside the Legacy Rate ($0.0035/R$).
4.  **Pending Sales Guide**: Estimates how long your Robux will be held in escrow (typically 3-7 days, up to 30 days for large amounts).

## 🧮 How to Calculate Roblox Tax

To manually calculate your earnings, you can use the formulas below, or simply visit **[robloxtax.com](https://robloxtax.com)** for an instant result without doing the math yourself.

### The 30% Marketplace Fee
Roblox charges a fee on all community sales (Gamepasses, Clothing, UGC).
*   **Formula:** `Profit = Price * 0.70`
*   **Example:** Selling an item for **1,000 R$** results in **700 R$** profit.
